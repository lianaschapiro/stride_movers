CUSTOMER AGREEMENT
Thank you for your interest in booking your job with Sven Moving.
PAYMENT: Payment must be made in cash, certified check, American Express, Discover, Master Card or Visa. The minimum for credit card payments is $300. If your job total is less than $300, you must pay cash. THERE IS A 5% DISCOUNT FOR PAYMENTS MADE IN CASH (PLEASE ALERT YOUR MOVERS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OFFER, AS NO REFUNDS WILL BE OFFERED AFTER PAYMENT IF YOU DO NOT SPECIFICALLY MENTION THIS DISCOUNT AT THE TIME OF PAYMENT). A 5% Service Charge will be added to all credit card payments. We do not accept personal checks. Tips must be in cash, and cannot be placed on a credit card. Please do try to tip your movers based on the quality and level of labor delivered.
INSURANCE: With regard to damages, the base level required by New York State for hourly moves is 30 Cents per pound, meaning if your 50 pound television is broken during the move, you can expect $15 in compensation. For a $50 surcharge, we can insure you for full value up to $5000 with a $500 deductible. Any coverage beyond that, you would need to get outside insurance coverage through another company. (Renterâ€™s insurance generally has some coverage for moving.) By confirming your move with a credit card you are agreeing to these terms. Please let the person on the phone know if you want the increased coverage. We can provide a certificate of insurance, but you must request it at least 48 hours in advance. Each certificate costs $20 (meaning if both your starting and ending locations require certificates, that would be $40). Please let us know as soon as possible if that is required. We have a form you will need to fill out and submit to us via email for us to process the certificate with our insurance company. We cannot come up with a certificate immediately on the job sight, as they have to be specific to the job and location, and our insurance company needs time (usually 48 hours) to create them and send them out in advance. 

ARRIVAL TIME: Please be aware that while we try to leave cushion time between jobs, we can sometimes run late due to the variables beyond our control, such as customers with more inventory than estimated, elevator issues, traffic and weather events. While we try our best to keep on schedule, moving is not an exact science. We sometimes run late and sometimes early. We will call ahead to let you know about changes in our arrival time. We appreciate your patience.

CANCELLATION/RESCHEDULE: If anything about your move changes, such as locations or timing, please inform us as soon as possible. Moving deposits (usually in the form a credit card number held in lieu of final payment) are non-refundable less than 48 hours before a job. If cancelling after that time, you will be charged the minimum possible total for your job (based on the hourly minimum quoted). This applies no matter what the reason for the cancellation is, even if it is only to delay the move to another date. 


YOUR POSSESSIONS: By far the largest problem we run into is arriving at jobs to find much more to be moved than was on the list sent to us by the customer. While on flat rate jobs, this may mean an adjustment in price, it also can mean we may not have a large enough vehicle or, perhaps more importantly, that we are going to be very late to the next customer. We book multiple jobs a day. If you have dramatically more than you previously informed us of, we reserve the right to limit the amount we will transport to the original agreement, so as not to cause an unreasonable delay on a following job. Please update us before the day of the move (preferably days before) if you find you are going to have more than you expected or that your original list was incomplete.


IKEA FURNITURE: We cannot dismantle or re-assemble any furniture other than bed frames. IKEA pieces, like wardrobes, are very complicated and are very difficult to deconstruct without damage. If your furniture, other than a bed-frame, needs to be disassembled to be moved, you will need to have this done before we arrive. (We can dis-assemble bed frames as long as you let us know in advance.) Furthermore, we cannot be responsible for IKEA furniture falling apart when moved. We do our best to protect it, but pressed-wood furniture is generally not sturdy, and often does not handle moving well. That said our insurance policy does not cover pressed-wood IKEA style furniture.

PARKING TICKETS: As there is often no legal parking at job sites, customers are encouraged to watch the moving vehicle during jobs to help avoid tickets. We will make our best effort to find legal parking, but this is not possible in many locations. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ALL PARKING TICKETS RECEIVED DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR MOVE. THE PARKING TICKET FINE WILL BE ADDED TO THE TOTAL BILL FOR THE MOVE AT THE END OF THE JOB.

DRIVING: Customers cannot ride along in the truck or van. This is per our insurance is to protect the customer as well. Please be sure to arrange your own transportation between locations if necessary.

BE PREPARED: Beyond that, please be as prepared as possible for your move. You should be completely packed before the movers arrive. Again, this is a courtesy to our other customers who are as anxious as you are to have a smooth moving day and have timing considerations of their own.
